    \begin{block}{The Folk theorem with average rewards}
        Consider any $n$-player normal-form game $\Gamma$ and any payoff profile
        $u = (u_1, \dots, u_n)$. Then\footnote{This version of the theorem is proven
        in the book "\textbf{Multiagent Systems}, Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical
        Foundations".}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $u$ is the payoff profile in any Nash equilibrium of the infinitely
            repeated $\Gamma$ with average rewards, then for each player $i$, $u_i$ is enforceable.
            \item If $u$ is both feasible and enforceable, then $u$ is the payoff profile for some
            Nash equilibrium of the infinitely repeated $\Gamma$ with average rewards.

\begin{frame}{Interpretation of the Folk theorem}
    \begin{exampleblock}{What does it mean?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first part of the theorem means that we can enforce any Nash equilibrium
            of the infinitely-repeated game
            \item The second part states that any payoff profile that is feasible and enforceable
            is the payoff profile of a Nash equilibrium 
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Folk Theorem}
    \textbf{Consequences}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interesting consequences: apparition of new Nash equilibrium's for certain games
        \item Example: prisoner's dilemna
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If proba of one more turn is large enough, cooperation of both players becomes a Nash equilibrium
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Folk Theorem}
    \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
        Consider the Prisoner's Dilemma in normal form.
        \begin{table}
            \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
                & {\color{red}c}    & {\color{red}d} \\
                \hline
                {\color{green}C}    & \payoff{-1}{-1}   & \payoff{-4}{~0} \\
                {\color{green}D}    & \payoff{~0}{-4}    & \payoff{-3}{-3} 
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Prisoner's Dilemma in normal form.}
        \end{table}
    \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\note{
    Simply prove that cooperation is feasible and enforceable:\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enforceability
            $v_1=\min_{s_{-1}\in S_{-1}} \max_{s_{1}\in S_{1}} u_1(s_{-1},s_1) =-3$\\
            $v_2=\min_{s_{-2}\in S_{-2}} \max_{s_{2}\in S_{2}} u_2(s_{-2},s_2) =-3$\\
            $r_1=-1\geq -3$,$r_2=-1\geq -3 \rightarrow$ enforceable \\
        \item Feasibility
            $\alpha_{(c,C)}= 1$, rest $\alpha=0 \rightarrow$ feasible
    \end{itemize}
    By Folk theorem $\rightarrow$ Nash equilibrium
